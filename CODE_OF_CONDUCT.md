## Expected Behavior

To foster a welcoming and inclusive community, we expect all participants to:

1. **Be Respectful:** Treat all individuals with respect and kindness, both online and in person. Disagreements and differences of opinion are inevitable, but they should be handled with civility and empathy.

4. **Be Mindful of Language:** Refrain from using derogatory, offensive, or discriminatory language and content.

5. **Provide Constructive Feedback:** Offer feedback and criticism constructively, focusing on the content and ideas rather than personal attacks.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

1. **Harassment:** Any form of harassment, discrimination, or unwelcome behavior based on personal characteristics mentioned in our pledge is unacceptable. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive comments, insults, threats, stalking, and unwelcome attention.
