## Submitting Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests and value your input to make SysWard better. Before you submit a feature request, please take a moment to search our existing issues and pull requests to see if someone else has already suggested the same idea or if it's already in progress. If you find a similar request, you can add your support or additional context in the comments.

To submit a new feature request, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Issues" tab in the top navigation bar of this repository.

2. Click the green "New Issue" button on the right side of the page.

3. Use the "Feature Request" template to provide details about your feature idea. Please include a clear and concise description of the feature you're proposing, why you believe it would be valuable, and any relevant context. The more information you provide, the better we can understand and evaluate your request.

4. Add appropriate labels to your issue, if applicable.

5. Click "Submit New Issue" to create your feature request.

Once your feature request is submitted, our team will review it, and it will be visible to the community for discussion and feedback.

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs can be frustrating, but your help in identifying and reporting them is crucial in improving the quality of our product. 

Before you report a bug, please check if a similar issue has already been reported to avoid duplication.

To report a bug, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Issues" tab in the top navigation bar of this repository.

2. Click the green "New Issue" button on the right side of the page.

3. Use the "Bug Report" template to provide detailed information about the bug you encountered. Include steps to reproduce the bug, the expected behavior, the actual behavior, and any relevant screenshots or error messages.

4. Add appropriate labels to your issue, if applicable.

5. Click "Submit New Issue" to create your bug report.

Our team will review your bug report, and if confirmed, we will prioritize and work on resolving it.

## Viewing the Roadmap
